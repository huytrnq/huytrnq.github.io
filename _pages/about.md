Iâ€™m an AI/Computer Vision Engineer and Erasmus Scholar currently pursuing a Master of Medical Imaging and Applications at the University of Girona, University of Cassino, and University of Burgundy. My work focuses on developing, optimizing, and deploying AI models for real-world impact, especially in the domains of medical imaging, smart traffic systems, and computer vision.

I have hands-on experience with deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal systems. My recent projects include fine-tuning vision-language models for clinical image localization, building structured-output extraction pipelines with LLMs, and automating workflows through MLOps and CI/CD pipelines in medical diagnostics.

Previously, I worked on vehicle detection and license plate recognition systems for smart traffic solutions, and developed models for thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound imaging. These projects reflect my commitment to using AI to solve high-impact, real-world problems.
