collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Helmet_Rule_Violation_Detection_for_Motorcyclists_Using_a_Custom_Tracking
excerpt: 'Many countries still face the challenge of enforcing the helmet rule and ensuring compliance among riders. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can differentiate between the driver and passengers and detect helmet rule violations for each rider empowered by computer vision and deep learning techniques.'
